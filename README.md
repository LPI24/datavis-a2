# DataVis Assignment 2
## First Attempt:
For the Assignment 2 initially I have chosen the following Variables for the plot (as you can see in the picture below):

- X-Axis: Horsepower
- Y-Axis: Dealer Cost
- Color: Vehicle Type
- Size (radius): Weight

Unfortunately, through the size of the circles it was really hard to distinguish the different circles in the plot. Therefore I have tried a new variable set up:

## Final Plot:

- X-Axis: Horsepower
- Y-Axis: Dealer Cost
- Color: Vehicle Type
- Shape (radius): AWD (y/n)

Instead of the weight as the size of a data dot I have chosen the AWD variable in two different shapes:
- circles for "No AWD"
- triangle for "AWD"

Furthermore I decided to change the Detail Overview from a text base solution to a table based solution beneath the plot.

The Star Plot next to the table visualizes the multivariate performance profile of the selected vehicle, comparing the following 6 attributes (normalized to the entire dataset):

- Retail Price

- Engine Size (l)

- Cylinders (Cyl)

- Horsepower (HP)

- City Miles Per Gallon (City MPG)

- Highway Miles Per Gallon (Highway MPG)
