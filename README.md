# DataVis Assignment 2
## First Attempt:
For the Assignment 2 initially I have chosen the following Variables for the plot (as you can see in the picture below):

- X-Axis: Horsepower
- Y-Axis: Dealer Cost
- Color: Vehicle Type
- Size (radius): Weight

Unfortunately, through the size of the circles it was really hard to distinguish the different circles in the plot. Therefore I have tried a new variable set up:

## Final Plot:

- X-Axis: Horsepower
- Y-Axis: Dealer Cost
- Color: Vehicle Type
- Shape (radius): AWD (y/n)

Instead of the weight as the size of a data dot I have chosen the AWD variable in two different shapes:
- circles for "No AWD"
- triangle for "AWD"

## Outlook:
- flying detail table and star diagram
